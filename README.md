# DataStructures

This set of programs is focused on the basic operations common to all data structures. These operations are:
- creation
- element access
- traversal
- element insertion
- element updates
- element deletion
- search
- deletion

This set of programs leads you through simple examples of all these operations. This is intended to provide a basis from which you can write your own code. Your own code just combines these operations together to solve a particular problem.

The program files in this lab will lead you through a demonstration of each operation for each of the data structures discussed in class. Do this work in the following order:
- strings.py
- lists.py
- files.py
- dictionaries.py

Work through the source files itertively, one step at a time (**code, run, repeat**).
